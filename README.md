# MSM.science: Interactive book on theory and practice of building impactfull models. 

**If you are a data scientist**, this book will help you make a consistent bottom-line impact in applied settings. 

**If you are a researcher**, this book will provide you a runway into research that is of practical relevance.

> All too often, however, there is a mismatch between the criterion used to choose the model, the criterion used to evaluate its performance, and the criterion which actually matters in real application - David Hand in [“Classifier Technology an Illusion of Progress”](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-21/issue-1/Classifier-Technology-and-the-Illusion-of-Progress/10.1214/088342306000000060.full)

Making a impact in applied settings takes more than training a neural network or an xgboost model on a mean-squarred error or cross-entropy loss function. Albeit just that, can take you sufficiently far to get started.

However, making a **consistent** impact in applied settings requires to critically evaluate and distill an unstructured (business) need or opportunity into a tractable mathematical framework. It requires recognising the tradeoffs of making assumptions, and accounting for the underlying causal structure. It requires developing an iterative and clear framework for developing, validating and testing the modeling solution both offline and online (i.e. in production), with offline metrics being as closely related to online metrics. 

Doing the above well takes patience to grasp foundational knowledge beyond supervised learning, but also intuition about the concepts from econometrics and economics, experiment design, ethics, causal inference, Bayesian and frequentist statistics.. Yet, these fields keep evolving, and with them so does the toolset that allows us to formulate the problems better. 

This open-source book helps you acquire foundational knowledge, as well as, latest theory and practice. It never stops distilling the latest advances in relevant theory, and thus unlocking your potential to tackle increasingly complex modeling problems. 

This  book represents a community-wide attempt to make you a data scientists or a researcher, whose models or research are always useful in practice, teaching you the concepts, the context, and the code, to formulate and iteratively solve a modelling problems of increasing complexity. The entire book is drafted in Jupyter notebooks, seamlessly integrating exposition figures, math, and interactive examples with self-contained code.
